# Unique flags

This plugin allows you to assign flags to a team and detect cheating.

## Installation

1. Copy the plugins to CTFd's plugin folder
2. Create your own challenges
3. Import the team previously generated with the script into the root folder (`team-generator.py`)
4. Import flags into admin interface


## Limitations

- This plugin only works in team mode
- Team names format is mandatory, so you must use the `Team-<letter>-<id>` format. Check the script: `team-generator.py` at the root folder for more information on group generations
